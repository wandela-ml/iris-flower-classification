# Iris Flower Classification

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three species
(Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their physical measurements.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic, well-structured dataset commonly used to introduce supervised machine learning.
It contains 150 samples with four numerical features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Target variable:
- Iris species (3 classes)

## Approach
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed basic data inspection and validation
- Prepared features and target variables
- Trained supervised classification models
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

## Models and Techniques Used
- Supervised classification
- Train-test split
- Model evaluation (accuracy and classification metrics)
- scikit-learn

## Results
The trained models were able to classify iris species with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of
basic supervised learning techniques on well-structured data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning workflows, model training,
and evaluation rather than model complexity.
